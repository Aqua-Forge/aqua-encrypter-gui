Encrypter usage:

    There is a button for instructions of how to use the Encrypter in the User Interface.
    To start the Encrypter, run: $python3 main.py
    *It is possible to encrypt more than once (to encrypt an encryption). In this case, use
    the respective passwords for decryption. E.G.:
    Original File --(Enc. Pass1)--> Encription 1 --(Enc. Pass2)--> Encription 2
    Encription 2 --(Dec. Pass2)--> Encription 1 --(Dec. Pass1)--> Original File

Symmetric Encription:

    Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to 
    both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. The entities communicating via symmetric
    encryption must exchange the key so that it can be used in the decryption process.
    By using symmetric encryption algorithms, data is converted to a form that cannot be 
    understood by anyone who does not possess the secret key to decrypt it. Once the intended 
    recipient who possesses the key has the message, the algorithm reverses its action so that 
    the message is returned to its original and understandable form.
